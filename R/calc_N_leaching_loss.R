#' Leaching loss nitrogen
#'
#' Precipitation-based method (c1)
#' Where rainfall is concentrated in the autumn-winter period, in general,that portion of nitrogen that enters the budget as "ready N" should be considered leachable. Whereas in situations with significant rainfall surplus even during the spring-summer period and with soils with low water retention, a fraction of the nitrogen from fertilization and that from S.O. mineralization should be considered leachable in addition to ready nitrogen. Leaching losses in the autumn-winter period are estimated by taking as a reference
#' the amount of precipitation in the interval from October 1 to January 31 as follows below:
#'  - with rainfall <150 mm: no losses:
#'  - with rainfall between 150 and 250 mm: progressively increasing loss of ready nitrogen;
#'  - with rainfall >250 mm: all ready nitrogen is lost.
#' To calculate the % of ready N that is considered to be leached as a function of rainfall, the following expression is used:
#'  x = (y - 150)
#' where: x>0 = percentage of ready nitrogen lost; y = rainfall in mm during October to January.

#' Ease of drainage method (c2)
#' The calculation of nitrogen losses in soil by leaching based on drainage and texture can be estimated by adopting the following scheme.
