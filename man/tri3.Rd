\title{Soil Texture Class Determination (Simplified)}
\usage{
tri3(clay = 10, sand = 35, tri3.table = NFert::tri3.table)
}
\arguments{
\item{clay}{Percentage of clay in the soil (0-100).}

\item{sand}{Percentage of sand in the soil (0-100).}

\item{tri3.table}{A matrix containing the simplified soil texture classes
based on clay and sand percentages. The default is \code{NFert::tri3.table}.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the simplified soil texture class
(e.g., "Sandy", "Loamy", "Clayey"). If the \code{clay} and \code{sand} combination
does not fall within the defined classes in \code{tri3.table}, returns NA.
}
\description{
Determines a simplified soil texture class based on clay and sand percentages.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item This function provides a simplified classification based on the USDA soil
texture triangle. For a more detailed classification, consider using the
\code{tri2()} function.
\item Ensure that \code{clay} and \code{sand} percentages are valid (within 0-100) and their
sum does not exceed 100.
}
}
\examples{
tri3(clay = 10, sand = 35)  # "Sandy"
tri3(clay = 25, sand = 20)  # "Loamy"
tri3(clay = 55, sand = 15)  # "Clayey"
}
