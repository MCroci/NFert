\title{Soil Group and ID_Rag Determination}
\usage{
calc_soil_group_and_id_rag(
  clay = 10,
  sand = 35,
  tri3.table = NFert::tri3.table,
  soil.table = NFert::soil.table
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clay}{Percentage of clay in the soil (0-100).}

\item{sand}{Percentage of sand in the soil (0-100).}

\item{tri3.table}{A matrix containing the simplified soil texture classes based on
clay and sand percentages. The default is \code{NFert::tri3.table}.}

\item{soil.table}{A data frame mapping soil texture classes (ID_Suo) to soil groups and ID_Rag.
It should have at least three columns: \code{ID_Suo}, \code{Group}, and \code{ID_Rag}. The default is obtained from the NFert package.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item soil.group: The soil group based on the USDA classification.
\item id_rag: The corresponding ID_Rag (numeric ID for the soil group).
}
}
\description{
Determines the soil group and ID_Rag based on clay and sand percentages using the USDA soil texture triangle.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Ensure the \code{clay} and \code{sand} percentages are valid (within 0-100) and their sum does not exceed 100.
\item The \code{soil.table} is assumed to contain accurate mappings between soil texture classes, groups, and ID_Rag values.
}

\examples{
calc_soil_group_and_id_rag(clay = 10, sand = 35)
calc_soil_group_and_id_rag(clay = 25, sand = 20)  # Clay loam
