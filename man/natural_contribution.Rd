\title{Natural Nitrogen Contribution}
\usage{
natural_contribution(
  location = "Plain adjacent to urbanized areas",
  ccp = "Autumn-winter crop <150 days",
  g.table = NFert::g.table,
  coef_time = NFert::coef_time
)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{The location or type of area (e.g., "Plain adjacent to urbanized areas"). Must match a value in the \code{location} column of the \code{g.table}.}

\item{ccp}{Crop category and planting period (e.g., "Autumn-winter crop <150 days"). Must match a value in the \code{ccp} column of the \code{coef_time} table.}

\item{g.table}{A data frame containing annual nitrogen deposition rates for different locations.
It should have at least two columns: \code{location} (character) and \code{annual_deposition} (numeric).
Defaults to \code{NFert::g.table}.}

\item{coef_time}{A data frame containing adjustment factors (C_tempo) based on crop category and planting period.
It should have at least two columns: \code{ccp} (character) and \code{C_tempo} (numeric).
Defaults to \code{NFert::coef_time}.}
}
\value{
The estimated natural nitrogen contribution in kg/ha, or \code{NA} if input values are not found in the respective tables.
}
\description{
Calculates the natural nitrogen (N) contribution from atmospheric deposition based on location and crop category.
}
\details{
The function calculates the natural nitrogen contribution using the following formula:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{G = annual_deposition * C_tempo
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \code{G} is the natural nitrogen contribution (kg/ha)
\item \code{annual_deposition} is the annual nitrogen deposition rate for the specified \code{location} (kg/ha/year)
\item \code{C_tempo} is the adjustment factor based on the \code{ccp}
}
}
\examples{
natural_contribution(location = "Plain adjacent to urbanized areas", ccp = "Autumn-winter crop <150 days")
natural_contribution(location = "Mountain area", ccp = "Spring-summer crop >150 days")
}
