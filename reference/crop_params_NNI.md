# Crop-specific parameters for the Nitrogen Nutrition Index pipeline

This function returns the default parameters used by the remote-sensing
NNI pipeline
([`compute_NNI_from_S2`](https://mcroci.github.io/NFert/reference/compute_NNI_from_S2.md))
for a given crop. Values are taken from the peer-reviewed literature and
represent first-guess defaults — they almost always require local
recalibration before operational use (see the *Calibration caveats*
section below).

## Usage

``` r
crop_params_NNI(crop)
```

## Arguments

- crop:

  Character. Canonical crop name (case-insensitive). Any of `"wheat"`,
  `"maize"`, `"rice"`, `"barley"`, `"rapeseed"`, `"sorghum"`,
  `"sunflower"`, `"soybean"`. A helpful error is raised otherwise.

## Value

A named list of seven numeric parameters plus the resolved canonical
`crop` name.

## Parameters

- a, b:

  Coefficients of the critical-N dilution curve \\N_c(\\) = a \cdot
  W^{-b}\\, with W in t DM ha\\^{-1}\\. Lemaire & Gastal (1997); Justes
  et al. (1994) for wheat; Plenet & Lemaire (2000) for maize; Sheehy et
  al. (1998) for rice; Colnenne et al. (1998) for rapeseed.

- w_min:

  Lower bound of validity of the dilution curve (t DM ha\\^{-1}\\). NNI
  is masked below this biomass.

- alpha_leaf:

  Leaf-to-total-aboveground biomass allocation coefficient during the
  vegetative stages the NNI is meant for. W_total = W_leaf / alpha_leaf,
  so that typical partitioning of 0.30 (maize) / 0.35 (wheat) / 0.40
  (rice) rescales the GPR-derived leaf biomass to aboveground biomass.

- k_NChl:

  Canopy-level N : chlorophyll ratio used when converting `CNC_Cab` (g
  Chl m\\^{-2}\\ ground) to canopy N (g N m\\^{-2}\\). Values in the
  50-80 range; defaults are those reported by Houles et al. (2007) and
  Baret et al. (2007) as first-guess for Sentinel-2. Not used when the
  pipeline is fed with `CNC_Cprot` (protein-retrieval path, which
  already returns canopy N directly).

- fvc_min:

  Minimum fractional vegetation cover required for the spectral signal
  to be dominated by canopy and not soil. Pixels below this threshold
  are masked out of the NNI retrieval.

## Calibration caveats

- The dilution-curve coefficients a and b are well established for the
  listed crops across European cropping systems; they rarely need
  recalibration.

- `alpha_leaf` and `k_NChl` are the two locally sensitive parameters.
  Under-calibrated values commonly introduce a 15-30pct bias in the
  final NNI map. A minimal calibration dataset consists of 30-50
  plot-level samples across the growing season, analysed for dry biomass
  (oven at 65 degC) and total plant N (Kjeldahl or Dumas), paired with
  the matching Sentinel-2 acquisition date.

- NNI is only meaningful inside crop-specific phenological windows (e.g.
  GS31-GS55 for wheat, V6-V12 for maize). Outside these windows the
  critical-N curve is not valid.

- When the scene is dominated by partially covered pixels (FVC \< 0.5),
  the GPR retrievals degrade because the soil signal enters the BRDF.
  Use `fvc_min` to prune them.
